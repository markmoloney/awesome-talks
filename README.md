* [The Science of Self-Compassion with Kristin Neff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0gtnOXAp-U) \
An awe-inspiring talk on the power of self-compassion. Kristin explains how self-esteem is a terrible solution to self-worth because it's only there for us when we're succeeding. Through our failures, an inevitible part of the human experience, self-esteem does a runner and we're left with zero self-worth and negativity. Self-Compassion provides a stable base that's there for us through the good times and the bad. Kristin Neff's research also found that self-compassion is linked to motivation and it is not weakness. She cleverly debunks some classic myths we all hear about self-compassion being the same as self-pity and other myths like this.
